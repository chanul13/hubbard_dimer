Welcome to dmrg101's documentation!
===================================

dmrg101 is an implementation in Python of the `Density Matrix
Renormalization Group algorithm
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group>`_
(DMRG).  It is written with a pedagogical focus, and it's probably not
suitable for realistic research projects. dmrg101 was developed to be used
as a tutorial code for the `Taipei Density Matrix Renormalization Group
Winter School <http://sites.google.com/site/dmrg101/home>`_.

The present documentation describes the use of the code *per-se*. For
other information you could visit:

- the `dmrg101's website <http://iglpdc.github.com/dmrg101>`_,
- the `Taipei Density Matrix Renormalization Group Winter School's website <http://sites.google.com/site/dmrg101/home>`_,
- the `school's tutorial website <https://dmrg101.readthedocs.org/en/tutorial/>`_.

This documentation has two parts, one for users of the code and another
for developers. If you are just interested in using the code to learn
physics or following the tutorial for the school, you will probably need
to read only the `User Documentation`_. If you are also interested in
modifying the code, expand it, or just want to dig into and mess around
you may want to read the `Developer Documentation`_.

Unless stated explicitily otherwise, all the materials are under a
:download:`MIT license<../LICENSE>`, meaning pretty much that you can use
it as you want.
