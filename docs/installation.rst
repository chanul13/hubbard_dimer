Installation
============

To use dmrg101 you need to have Python and a few Python packages installed
in your machine. This section tells you how to do that. Note that there
are multiple ways to install all this. We are assuming here that you are
not familiar with Python, or have no Python installed at all in your machine. 

We describe what we think is the simplest way to have all the required
packages installed. 

Recommended way to install the requirements
-------------------------------------------

In case you don't have Python installed at all in your machine, you have
basic Python installation but not all the packages required, or you tried
another routes without success, you are best bet is to install the
`Enthought Python Distribution
<https://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ (EPD).

The EPD is free, ships with all the stuff we need, and it has
versions for MacOSX, Linux and Windows. You have two choices:

- get a academic license,  `EPD Academic
  <http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php>`_ if you qualify
  [#]_,
- get a free licence, `EPD
  Free <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php>`_ otherwise.

The academic license has more packages (more than wnat we need for the
dmrg101), but it may be a better choice if you plan to keep using Python
in the future.

Alternatives
------------

There are a lot of alternatives to install the software required by
dmrg101, we list some for those more familiar with Python.

- Windows
- Linux
- MacOSX

    institution. See the `license terms
