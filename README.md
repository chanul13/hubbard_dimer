DMRG101
=======

A pedagogical implementation in Python of the [Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group) algorithm for the [Taipei DMRG Winter School](https://sites.google.com/site/dmrg101/).

This repository hosts the materials for the tutorials on the DMRG algorithm
used in the school. You will find here an implementation of the DMRG
algorithm written in Python, the documentation for this code, and the
tutorial itself including some exercises for the students in the school.

The material is aimed to be self-content so it can be also used by people
interested in learning DMRG, but who were not able to attend the school.
The computer code is intended to be pedagogical, with less emphasis on
performance so it's probably not useful for research purposes. 

For more information, take a look to the [documentation for the code and the tutorial] (http://dmrg101.rtfd.org).

*Have fun!*
