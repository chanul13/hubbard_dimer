    If the argument is already a real number does nothing.  It works only with
    numbers, not with other user defined types, such as numpy arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    real_or_complex_number : a real or complex number.
        The number you want to get real.

    Returns
    -------
    result : a double
        The real part of `real_or_complex_number`.
 
    Examples
    --------
    >>> real_number = 1.0
    >>> print get_real(real_number)
    1.0
    >>> complex_number = complex(1, 2)
    >>> print complex_number
    (1+2j)
    >>> print get_real(complex_number)
    1.0
