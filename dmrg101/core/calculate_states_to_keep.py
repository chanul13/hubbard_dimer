    """Increases the number of states linearly during the finite algorithm.
    
    During the finite algoeithm not all the sweeps are performed keeping
    the same number of states. A good way to increase the number of states
    linearly in each half-sweep. The last sweep is always performed at
    final number of states.

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_states : an int.
        The number of states you are keeping at the beginning of the finite
	algorithm, which is the same as the number of states that you kept
	at the end of the infinite algorithm.
    final_states : an int.
        The number of states you will keep at the end of the finite
	algorithm.
    number_of_sweeps : an int.
        The number of (full) sweeps during the finite algorithm.
    
    Returns
    -------
    result : a list of ints.
        A list with the number of states kept at each *half-sweep*.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from dmrg101.core.calculate_states_to_keep import
    ... calculate_states_to_keep
    >>> print calculate_states_to_keep(20, 100, 5)
