    """Diagonalizes a hermitian or symmetric matrix.
    
    You use this function to diagonalize the reduced density matrix. 
    It just calls the corresponding routine in numpy.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    reduced_density_matrix : a numpy array with ndim = 2 (a matrix) 
        Should be hermitian (if complex), or symmetric (if real).
    
    Returns
    -------
    eigenvals : a numpy array with ndim = 1.
        The eigenvalues (not ordered) of the reduced density matrix.
        The number of eigenvalues is the size if the matrix.
    eigenvecs : a numpy array with ndim = 1.
        The corresponding eigenvectors. Each column correspond to an
        eigenvector, such as eigenvecs[ : i] corresponds to
        eigenvals[i].
    
    Raises
    ------
    DMRGException 
        if the computation cannot be performed.

    You use this function to truncate the set of eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix to keep only the ones
    with larger eigenvalue. The number of eigenvalues kept is
    number_of_states_to_keep.

    If the number_of_states_to_keep is larger than the number of
    eigenvalues, all the eigenvalues are kept.
    
    The order of the columns in the matrix with the eigenvectors is
    not changed, i.e. if in the reduced_density_matrix passed as
    argument, the eigenvectors for the i-th and j-th eigenvalues
    satisfied i < j and both are kept, then i_p < j_p, where i_p, j_p
    are the column indexes that these eigenvectors occupy in the 
    the resulting truncated matrix.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    reduced_density_matrix_eigenvals : a numpy array with ndim = 1
        The eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (not need to be
	ordered).
    reduced_density_matrix_eigenvecs : a numpy array with ndim = 2
        The eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix.
    number_of_states_to_keep : an int 
        The number of eigenvalues (or eigenvectors) kept. It is the same
	as the dimension of the truncated Hilbert space.
    
    Returns
    -------
    truncated_eigenvals : a numpy array with ndim = 1.
        The eigenvalues kept in the same order as before.
    transformation_matrix : a numpy array with ndim = 2.
        The eigenvectors kept. this defines the DMRG transformation (a.k.a.
        truncation) matrix.

    Raises
    ------
    DMRGException
