        """Performs one step of the finite DMRG algorithm.
    
        Calculates the ground state of a system with a given size, then
        performs the DMRG transformation on the operators of *one* block,
        therefore increasing by one site the number of sites encoded in the
        Hilbert space of this block, and reset the block in the system to be
        the new, enlarged, truncated ones. The other block is read out from
        the previous sweep.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
	growing_side : a string.
	    Which side, left or right, is growing.
        left_block_size : an int.
            The number of sites in the left block in the *current* step, not
    	    including the single site.     
        number_of_states_kept : an int.
            The number of states you want to keep in each block after the
    	    truncation. If the `number_of_states_kept` is smaller than the
    	    dimension of the current Hilbert space block, all states are kept.
     
        Returns
        -------
        energy : a double.
            The energy at this step.
        entropy : a double.
            The Von Neumann entropy for the cut at this step.
        truncation_error : a double.
            The truncation error, i.e. the sum of the discarded eigenvalues of
    	    the reduced density matrix.
    
        Raises
        ------
        DMRGException
            if `growing_side` is not 'left' or 'right'.
    
        Notes
        -----
        This asymmetric version of the algorithm when you just grow one of the
        block while keeping the other one-site long, is obviously less precise
        than the symmetric version when you grow both sides. However as we are
        going to sweep next using the finite algorithm we don't care much
        about precision at this stage.
